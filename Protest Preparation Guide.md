# Protest Preparation Guide: Levels of Readiness

I've put together this guide to help people prepare at different levels of involvement. Let me know about any changes or additions you would make to this list - I'm happy to consider and edit this. Please feel free to share or repost.

## Understanding the Levels

I think there are multiple levels of preparedness and I will cover the first 2 in detail:

**Level 0:** You want to show up, have your voice heard, and maybe meet some like-minded people. Most protests are completely uneventful - you march, you chant, you go home.

**Level 1:** You want to march with a bit more preparation - you're thinking about contingencies and what-ifs. If it gets a little wild you are ducking out of there. If you are looking around and observing what the police are doing and how they are dressed, you can usually figure out if it's about to get wild.

**Level 2:** You want to march and stick around some if it gets wild.

**Level 3a:** You want to march and provide medical care if it gets wild. As a medic I was usually dressed as Level 1, ready to get into Level 2, and then 3a is the medical stuff I carried for others.

**Level 3b:** You want to march and be defensive front-line when it is getting wild.

## Know Your Rights

Before attending any protest, familiarize yourself with your legal rights. Understanding what you can and cannot do - and what police can and cannot do - helps you stay safe and make informed decisions.

**Key resources:**

- **ACLU Know Your Rights: Protesters' Rights** - [aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights)

**Quick summary of rights:**

- You have the right to photograph and record police in public spaces
- You have the right to remain silent if stopped or questioned
- You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or belongings
- If arrested, you have the right to an attorney - ask for one immediately
- Police cannot delete your photos or videos without a court order

---

## Level 0: Just Show Up

The most important thing you can do is show up. The vast majority of people who attend protests have zero problems - they march, they chant, they connect with others who share their values, and they go home.

Protests can be energizing, community-building experiences. There's something powerful about standing alongside others who care about the same issues you do. You might make new friends, learn about local organizations doing good work, or simply feel less alone in your beliefs.

Don't let the preparation advice in the rest of this guide intimidate you. Most of it is for edge cases and worst-case scenarios. For many protests, you can literally just show up, walk around, hold a sign, and leave whenever you want. That's it. Your presence matters and adds to the collective voice.

If you're new to protesting, find a permitted daytime march in a public space - these tend to be the most straightforward and family-friendly. Have fun with it.

## Level 1: Simple Attendance (Leaving If It Gets Wild)

Below is likely overkill, but I like being prepared. You could just show up for a walk and leave when you want. That's pretty simple and will really help show support. With a little extra work you can be more prepared:

**Basic Supplies**

- This could be an all day activity so bring food and water (better if you have some to share with others - be part of the support system)
- Sunscreen, weather appropriate clothes, extra layers as day turns to night
- If you are bringing a backpack add a small med kit for scrapes, blisters, etc.
- Cash in small bills - useful if you need to buy supplies, make phone calls if detained, or if payment systems are down. Also leaves no digital payment trail
- Necessary prescription medications (inhaler, insulin, epipen, etc.) since you could be out longer than expected or arrested

**Buddy System**

- Find a buddy and stick with them
- Define backup communication plans (aside from phones) in case you get separated
- Define backup meeting spots
- Look out for each other

**Phone Behavior**

- Put a strong PIN on your phone and turn off the biometrics like facial recognition and fingerprint. If you are arrested the police can use those without your consent (also the legal threshold is lower) to get into your phone revealing all your contacts, all your messages, all your photos...
- If you keep biometrics enabled, know how to quickly force PIN-only mode:
  - **iPhone:** Press and hold the side button + either volume button for 2 seconds, or press the side button 5 times rapidly
  - **Android:** Most devices have a "Lockdown" option - press and hold the power button and tap "Lockdown" (enable this in Settings > Security if you don't see it)
- Remember: the most secure your phone can be is powered off. A powered-off phone is much harder to extract data from
- Careful who and what you photograph. People may not want to be identified, you may not want to be identified. We didn't keep records or photos of our patients for their safety.
- Put it into airplane mode (or off) if you don't want to be identified. We know ICE and other agencies have stingrays. The telcos will also supply the feds with data about who connected to their towers.
- Use encrypted communication apps like Signal

**Identification**

- Bring ID - it will be helpful if you're arrested to get processed a little faster.

**Phone Numbers**

- If you're arrested you won't have your phone to look up numbers or be willing to unlock it in that situation
- In advance, write in sharpie on your body (like your inside arm or belly) phone numbers you may need. Someone to bail you out, a lawyer, or whatever you need
- National Lawyers Guild (NLG) Mass Defense: (212) 679-5100
- Before attending protests, check nlg.org/chapters to find your local NLG chapter - many operate protest hotlines staffed by volunteers during demonstrations
- Consider donating to bail support funds and legal aid organizations - they are working overtime

**Mask**

- Consider wearing a mask at all times like a buff or an N95, we all still have COVID stuff so use it. Also you're in a crowd, save yourself from a few germs
- Consider if you are willing to be identified. I think there is value in being identified and public about your beliefs. Letting people see your face and being public about your beliefs is a strong message that this is the right thing
- There is also risk to this as some may seek retribution for your opinions. This could be the government, people who disagree with you and want to cause physical harm to you, lose your job, etc. You may also be near some actually illegal activity or take part in it and you don't want to be tangled up in that if you can avoid it.

**Footwear**

- Closed toe shoes - you are in a crowd, you may get stepped on, you may need to run
- Though if the crowd panics I encourage you to walk quickly and try to encourage others to slow down too. Lots of trampling injuries happen in a panicked crowd, being an island of calm can be contagious

**Ear Protection**

- Ear plugs to dampen noise. Being in a crowd and shouting all day can leave you drained and with a headache. Ear plugs will help
- If you aren't going to a next level, over the ear protection can be useful, but it's hard to put that on along with a respirator and helmet (unless you start getting military surplus style stuff)
- Police may also deploy acoustic weapons (LRAD) and ear plugs help tolerate these attacks.

**Eye Protection**

- Sunglasses for the day, clear glasses for the night
- They need to be shatterproof. Most are these days

**Clothing**

- Long sleeves and pants. Help protect from the sun, elements, and chemical weapons that might be deployed. Rain jacket helps for water, as a blood barrier if you are helping others, and keep some chemical weapons off your skin.

## Level 2: Stick Around If It Gets a Little Wild

We need to enhance protections now. This means a lot of flying munitions from the police, potentially police charges with batons and fists, and almost certainly chemical weapons being used by the police.

**Respiratory and Eye Protection**

- Full face respirator to protect eyes and breathing from chemical munitions, also protects face against flying objects (you like your eyes and being able to breathe long term right?)
- If you can't do this go for a respirator and goggles to protect your eyes
- Reminder that dark tinted ski goggles suck to wear at night

**Helmet**

- Protect your head from flying munitions

**Gloves**

- Leather gloves (or at least gloves). These can serve as an ok blood barrier if you are helping someone else, good to protect your hands from scrapes, and good to help deal with tear gas canisters
- I've helped someone with a full palm blister because he picked up a tear gas canister. The canisters are hot as hell to disperse the chemical weapon
- Consider just kicking them back at the people who attacked you with it, covering it with a cone and dumping water on it to cool it down and stop the dispersal, or in case you need to throw one over an object away from people

**Water/Hydration**

- Water bottle or hydration pack for drinking, but also useful for rinsing eyes if hit with chemical weapons. Keep what you are putting your mouth on separate from what may go into eyes.
- Having extra water beyond what you'd normally bring for the day is valuable at this level

**Change of Clothes**

- Keep a change of clothes in a ziploc bag
- If you got chemical weapons on you and can't get home quickly these are nice to change into to stop the irritation
- Can also be useful if you need to change clothes and looks
- Also useful if your stuff gets wet and you want to stay out there
- If you got chemical weapons deployed on you take a cold shower when you get home. Imagine you have motor grease or poison ivy on you and scrub them off - a hot shower will reactivate the weapons and your shower will suck harder than the cold shower

**Collapsible Umbrella**

- Useful if it rains or as sun protection
- Also useful to stop some of the munitions flying at you
- It won't do shit against a real bullet, but can stop tear gas canisters, pepper balls, some rubber bullets

## Level 3a: Going as a Medic

You're going as a medic and sticking around to help others. I have a separate list for all that and may create a separate post. Try to identify yourself with visual markers so others can find you and get aid from you. Unfortunately, in my experience, this also increases your likelihood of being targeted by attackers.

Be prepared for people with acute stress responses, scrapes and blisters from hiking, dehydration, tear gas/pepper spray in eyes, head and face injuries, lacerations from rubber bullets, burns from tear gas canisters, asthma attacks, rolled ankles, etc. I found a stethoscope useless with all the background noise, if you are stuck for room or have a nice expensive stethoscope that's for sure something you can leave at home.

We also carried juice boxes. It's amazing how much a juice box can help calm someone down, give them hydration, a few extra calories, and something to distract them. Reminder about breathing techniques to help calm people down, deal with asthma, reduce pain, and reduce stress. The breath is a powerful thing and is often an underutilized tool in your tool kit (plus it's free and everyone can use it)

## Level 3b: Front-Line Defensive

You're sticking around when it gets wild and you want to be front-line defensive. I have no experience here but I've seen more body padding (elbow and knee pads, chest and back protectors) or body armor (you're now thinking bullets are flying), defensive shields, lasers to help point out trouble to others, communication surveillance and jammers, and perhaps weapons to help fight back against illegal attacks against you and others.

**Important:** The legality of some of this equipment and these activities is very questionable and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Body armor, shields, jammers, lasers, and weapons may be illegal to possess or use in your area, especially at protests. Research your local laws carefully and understand the legal risks you may be taking.

## Final Thoughts

Please be safe, be legal, and stand up for your rights and others. I love you and wish there wasn't a need for this post.

Stay vigilant, support each other, and remember that your presence matters.
